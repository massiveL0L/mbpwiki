This is open-source _purely_ for being prepared over IP-grabbing allegations. In fact, I made this **client-side** so you can just pull up inspect element and see that **_nothing_** is wrong!

So please, if you wish to "expose" me, take note of that.
You know what would also make you look like a clown? I'm using free hosting, thanks to _Infinityfree_.
